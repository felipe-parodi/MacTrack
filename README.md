# MacTrack: Whole-Body Pose Tracking for Multiple Socializing Non-Human Primates
*Project under development*
MacTrack is an open-source project that provides a foundation model and large-scale dataset for whole-body pose tracking of multiple socializing non-human primates. This tool is designed for use by primatologists, neuroscientists, ethologists, and other researchers interested in quantifying natural primate behavior.

The MacTrack dataset includes annotated video recordings of socializing non-human primates engaged in a variety of behaviors, such as grooming, playing, and socializing. The dataset is suitable for training and testing whole-body pose tracking models and can be used to develop and validate new methods for analyzing primate behavior.

The MacTrack foundation model is a deep learning-based approach for whole-body pose tracking that can be trained on the MacTrack dataset or other similar datasets. The model is optimized for tracking multiple individuals simultaneously and can provide accurate, high-resolution whole-body pose estimates in real-time.

### Directories
data: This directory contains the MacTrack dataset, which includes annotated video recordings of socializing non-human primates engaged in a variety of behaviors. The dataset is organized into subdirectories for different primate species and behaviors.

docs: This directory contains documentation for the MacTrack project, including user guides, tutorials, and technical specifications.

results: This directory contains the output data and analysis results generated by the scripts in the "src" directory. These results can be used for further analysis and visualization of the kinematic measures calculated for each camera view.

scripts: This directory contains scripts for data preprocessing, model training and evaluation, and other analysis tasks.

src: This directory contains the source code for the MacTrack foundation model and associated utilities. The code is organized into subdirectories for different components of the model, such as data loading, model training, and pose estimation.

tests: This directory contains scripts for testing the functionality and performance of the MacTrack foundation model.

### Getting Started
To get started with using MacTrack, you can download the MacTrack dataset from the "data" directory and use it to train the MacTrack foundation model. The code for the model is provided in the "src" directory, along with scripts for model training and evaluation.

To use the MacTrack model to track the pose of individuals in new videos, you can use the provided scripts in the "scripts" directory to preprocess the data and generate whole-body pose estimates.
